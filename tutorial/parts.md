Please read the readme files! As of 9/3/2025 the latest version is 4.0 |
| ESP32 30pin |     1    | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a30c7c9f-4fdf-4c74-ace4-a51401cb46fd) | [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Teyleten-Robot-ESP-WROOM-32-Development-Microcontroller/dp/B08246MCL5/) [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806150650156.html) | The project currently uses an esp32 wroom 30pin |
| HCTL HC-MX3.0-2&ast;6Y | 2 | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b91a25e4-a98d-498c-987d-d6b55054c640) | [lcsc](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/C3294363.html) | 2x6 molex microfit connector. For manifold connector and pressure sensors |

| CJT(Changjiang Connectors) C3030F-TP-A (MOLEX MICROFIT PINS) | 48 (30 without optional microfits) | <img width="644" height="572" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab7e9c33-ece1-4ede-95e0-09abcc4c9855" /> | [lcsc](https://www.lcsc.com/product-image/C882167.html) | You need a minimum of 30 of these for the required connectors, or 48 for every connector. Please ensure you buy a few more than you will need in case you mess up some. |
| 3a fuse | 1 | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53e73bb0-d1ce-4a3c-92dd-98fcaf59c8d1) | - | 3 amp fuse for the board |

### Controller Parts
| Part Name  | qty | image | Link | info |
| --------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| ESP32-2432S032C | 1 | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebe637e1-e9b9-4a58-8b3b-ed3ad396a6df) | [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLGDHS16) | This is the original oasman controller, a 3.2" screen that the controller code was designed for. You can find it on many websites. Although this screen works and is cheap, it tends to have issues with the power button, which will affect it's ability to be used without being plugged in to power if you are unlucky |
| Waveshare 2.8" ESP32-S3 | 1 | <img width="726" height="556" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31013aed-c386-4a04-9225-bc04f9f52ae5" /> | [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Capacitive-Development-Peripheral-Interfaces-Resolution/dp/B0D8KKRV5V/) | This is a better controller. It is slightly smaller but has the same resolution. It contains a faster processor and the screen runs smoother. It also has better button functionality. If you can spend a bit more and are okay with a smaller device, this one is recommended for it's higher quality. |
| Battery | 1 | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6bf7070-4a0c-4cad-a41a-d973b082fe83) | [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DPZVBKMY) | -*Optional*- You need a small battery (600ma or more) with a jst 1.25 connector if you want the controller to work without being plugged in (aka wirelessly). Works on either controller. |
| 3D printed case | 1 | - | - | You are going to want to 3d print the files for assembling the case. If you don't own a 3d printer, you will want to order these files printed online or from one of the discord members |


### Manifold Parts

| Part Name  | qty | image | Link | info |
| --------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| (Option #1) Generic Ebay Manifold & Pressure sensors kit | 1 | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b4588cb-15ce-406a-bedc-2fd31b9598e9) | [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Display-Suspension-Manifold-Controller-Solenoid/dp/B0F1STPNBH)<!--[ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/324238773355)--> | This is a nice kit of manifold + pressure sensors for $150. Of you can purchase them separate like option #2 below. The guage is not used btw! <br><br>-*NOTE*- There are some reports of bad solder quality on the connector. You may want to reflow the connector or purchase a different manifold to ensure safety. |
| (Option #2.a) Generic Ebay Manifold | 1 | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d73bb078-ae31-4118-87ea-b4fd3c6de5ba) | [ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/175635451020)<!--[ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/324238773355) price went up $20 on this one --> | All the documentation is based on this manifold and it's wiring. If you use a different manifold you need to follow the wiring diagrams on the PCB carefully <br><br>-*NOTE*- There are some reports of bad solder quality on the connector. You may want to reflow the connector or purchase a different manifold to ensure safety. |
| (Option #2.b) 200PSI pressure sensor | 5 | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a231e73f-f6e8-48e3-80ee-d0554a466072) | [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYHW1R2Z) | This is a kit, we will not be using the screen, but it is cheaper than buying individually and more reliable than purchasing the sensors from a random supplier, as they often end up being duds. This kit also includes plenty of wiring, eliminating the need to purchase more wiring for the pressure sensors |
| 18 Gauge 6 Conductor Electrical Wire | 10ft+ | <img width="495" height="808" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83c3b96d-18e7-4724-8930-a8513b1924e3" /> | [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/DEKIEVALE-Conductor-Electrical-Stranded-Extension/dp/B0BX8T5ZFN/?th=1) | You need 4 wires to handle 12v, ground, acc, and compressor, and then 2 more optionally for e-brake and auxillary output |
| Various 1/8 NPT PTC connectors | 0-12 | - | - | Depending on your setup you may configure the ports differently. Easiest route is using all PTC and 1/4" hoses to everything. For a typical manifold with 4 faces, and 2 on each end, you would use 5 1/4npt DOT approved push to connec connectors, then 1 1/4npt muffler for the output (or another 1/4npt PTC connector), then 2 1/4npt plugs for the other end of the manifold. |
| 3D printed manifold base hat and lid | 1 | - | - | You are going to want to 3d print the files for assembling the manifold and pcb together in a nice package. If you don't own a 3d printer, you will want to order these files printed online or from one of the discord members |
<!-- | 12V Stabilizer | 1 | ![20241205_131439](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77595e2d-b98f-428d-9c74-689fca6c2d4f) | [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/YABOANG-9-40V-12V3A-Transformer-Instruments/dp/B0CZ8GYJC5?th=1) | Car electronics are not a perfect 12v, would be a good idea to run one of these on the 12v input to stabilize the voltage and help prevent possible issues | -->

### Additional Parts

| Part Name  | qty | image | Link | info |
| --------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Relay | 2 | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d14dc4ea-0366-496f-81c5-a614b326eb65) | [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T35K8S2) | You also may want a relay to control the compressor and the optional auxillary output. (Please double check your requirements for the compressor relay and amps!!!!! Requirements vary depending on your compressor setup, which is out of the scope of OAS-Man. OAS-Man only supplies the signal of when to turn on the compressor, not the full power.) |
