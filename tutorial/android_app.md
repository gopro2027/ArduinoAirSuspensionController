# Mobile App

Our android/ios app is written in the flutter SDK.

Currently it is not released for IOS yet, but you can download and install the APK manually on andorid.

You can find the latest APK files in this folder [here](https://github.com/gopro2027/ArduinoAirSuspensionController/tree/main/builds/Android)

As of 9/3/2025, the app just has basic functionality just to help you get your car up if you happen to forget your controller or something, but eventually it will have all the same functionality as the mobile controller.

Huge shoutout to our app devs, mustafa1234 and Efini in the discord server for their work on the mobile app, while I focus on other aspects of the project. Thanks guys!
